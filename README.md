# RECTIGRAPH
A small tool to extract almost rectilinear roads from a graph (NetworkX, OSMnx)
The function to detect quasi-rectilinear contiguous edges in a directed graph seems quite efficient: on the London OSM graph with ~200K edges, it takes ~1s to identify all "meta-edges". It should work both for directed and undirected networkx graphs.
The code has not been thoroughly checked, so use with care. If you find important bugs, please report them here! Thanks.
